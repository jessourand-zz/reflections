When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Especially when collaborating.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If someone else were to update my remote repository, it may conflict with
    my local repository. It is better for me to be in control.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a copy of a repository from someone else's GitHub remote repository.
    It originates, and copies to, the GitHub website.
    A clone is copied from an online GitHub remote repository, and downloaded
    locally onto my computer.
    A branch is another version of the same code. We learned branches in lesson
    2.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    In case it was updated recently? I'm not sure I understand the question..
